# Rust Ray Tracer

![A render from the engine showing three central spheres (matte, metallic, and a glowing glass orb) surrounded by hundreds of smaller, randomly generated spheres.](./main.png)
*<p align="center">**(Render from the Engine!)**</p>*

A high-performance, multithreaded ray tracing engine built from scratch in Rust. This project renders a complex, procedurally generated scene with physically-based materials including diffuse surfaces, metals, and dielectrics (glass). It demonstrates key computer graphics principles and leverages Rust's powerful concurrency model for significant performance gains.

## ðŸ“¸ Gallery

Here are some scenes rendered with the engine. For best results, render at high resolution (e.g., 1280x720) and use a high sample count to produce clean, noise-free images.

## âœ¨ Features

-   [x] **Multithreaded Rendering:** Utilizes `std::thread` and `Arc` to parallelize the rendering process across all available CPU cores, dramatically reducing render times. The time reduction is about x16 comparing to single-threaded when creating 16 threads on a CPU capable of procressing all of those threads concurrently.
-   [x] **Configurable Camera:** A fully implemented camera with adjustable field-of-view, position, and **Depth of Field (Defocus Blur)**.
-   [x] **Advanced Material System:**
    -   [x] **Lambertian (Diffuse):** Simulates matte surfaces with realistic light scattering.
    -   [x] **Metal (Reflective):** Simulates metallic surfaces with configurable reflection fuzziness.
    -   [x] **Dielectric (Refractive):** Simulates transparent materials like glass and water using Snell's Law for refraction.
    -   [x] **Emissive (Light Emitting):** Allows objects to act as light sources, contributing to global illumination.
-   [x] **Procedural Scene Generation:** The main scene is generated at runtime, placing hundreds of spheres with randomized positions and materials.
-   [x] **Object Primitives:**
    -   [x] Spheres

-   [ ] **(Planned)** Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) for render acceleration.
-   [ ] **(Planned)** Support for Triangle Meshes (loading `.obj` files).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Running the Engine

The scene is currently hardcoded in `src/main.rs`.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kanay2005/ray-tracing.git
    cd ray-tracing
    ```

2.  Run the project in release mode for optimal performance:
    ```bash
    cargo run --release
    ```

3.  The final render will be saved as `render.png` in the root directory. The process can take several minutes depending on your hardware.

## ðŸ’¡ Technical Learnings

This project was a deep dive into Rust's performance and safety features in the context of a computationally intensive task.

-   **Fearless Concurrency:** Using `Arc<T>` for shared, thread-safe ownership of scene data (like materials and objects) was critical. This avoids costly data clones for each thread while guaranteeing memory safety, which is a core strength of Rust.
-   **Dynamic Dispatch:** The use of trait objects (`Box<dyn Material>`) provides a flexible material system. It allows any object that implements the `Material` trait to be stored and used interchangeably at runtime, making it easy to extend the engine with new material types without changing the core rendering logic.
